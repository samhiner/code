	<div class='info'><p>There are 4 important functions of Congress. Passing bills, resolutions, and amendments; as well as holding confirmation votes for presidential nominees for certain positions.</p>
	<p>Whenever a Congressperson wants to make a new law about anything or spend the government’s money, they create a bill. A bill starts in the house of the congressperson (unless it is an appropriations bill, where it always starts in the House). First, it is assigned to review by certain committees that pertain to the bill. This assignment is done by the leader of the house that the bill is in. This leader therefore as a lot of sway on whether a bill passes. These committees then submit a recommendation back to the house about how to proceed. They could recommend to not vote on the bill, to vote on an altered version of the bill, or they could do nothing (also called pigeonholing). Their recommendation is not binding and if they pigeonhole the bill can be brought out of committee by a majority vote of the house it is in. However, they usually have a lot of sway in decision making as they take a much closer look at the bill. 
	<p>Once a bill gets out of committee, it is voted on by the house at large. Members may choose to vote yes, no, abstain, or never even show up for the vote. If a majority of the votes are cast for the bill, it passes (except for filibusters in the Senate). Once is passes the first house, it is sent to the next house. In the next house, it is pretty much the same situation. There are just a few differences between the houses, which are expanded upon on the other pages. Finally, bills are sent to the president, and he can sign it, veto it, or wait until it automatically becomes law. If he vetoes it, his veto can be overridden by a ⅔’s vote of each house.</p>
	<p>Another kind of legislation is a resolution. This is just one of the houses agreeing on something. It may be to recognize something or call on someone to do something, but it only needs to be voted on by that house, and if it passes the vote, it becomes resolved. </p>
	<p>Finally, there are amendments. Amendments must pass a ⅔’s vote in each house. Then, it must pass ⅔’s of state legislatures. When this happens, it is considered ratified and becomes a part of the US Constitution.</p></div>
