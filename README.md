<<<<<<< HEAD
* **Nothing** No projects yet.

## Web Development (PHP + HTML/CSS)
* **Chatroom** Very basic chatroom which manages accounts with MYSQL and writes to a file for messages. Good as a template for writing a quick means of communication. Requires you to write database info in login.php, register.php, and verify.php to work.
* **HTML Builder*** Writes HTML for people who do not know the language. Currently only includes formatted text and images, hence the asterisk. It usually makes more sense to just learn HTML, but when you are in a rush and need support for someone to write basic html this will do.

* **Stock Research Evaluation**
	* **Quiz**: You are given information on a stock and submit whether you are bearish or bullish on the stock. You are awarded points if this matches analyst's opinions. 
	* **Removal**: If the quiz was not able to find information on a stock, this will remove it from the stock list for the quiz.
	* **Cleaner**: Jupyter Notebook which turns the raw HTML from which the stock list for the quiz was extracted into a clean list.

It usually makes more sense to just learn HTML, but when you are in a rush and need support for someone to write basic html this will do. You run builder.php and it writes to code.php.
* **Online Console** Styles embedded repl.it file so that the source is not visible and it just looks like a console. All you have to do is upload your code to repl.it and replace the iframe with your embedded code. Used as template for showing python projects at samhiner.com.
