# Projects Information

## Javascript
* **Strategy Game*** A simple game where you manage a country in a top-down map style. (Mix between CivClicker and Sid Meier's Civ)

## Python
* **Nothing** No projects yet.

## Web Development (PHP + HTML/CSS)
* **Chatroom** Very basic chatroom which manages accounts with MYSQL and writes to a file for messages. Good as a template for writing a quick means of communication. Requires you to write database info in login.php, register.php, and verify.php to work.
* **HTML Builder*** Writes HTML for people who do not know the language. Currently only includes formatted text and images, hence the asterisk. It usually makes more sense to just learn HTML, but when you are in a rush and need support for someone to write basic html this will do.

# Extra Information

**License** Everything is under the MIT License, meaning if anyone sees this they are able to use the code in any way they like.

*Projects with an asterisk do not have their main intended features implemented and may not work.
