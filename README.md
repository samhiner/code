# Projects Information

## Javascript
* **Strategy Game*** A simple game where you manage a country in a top-down map style. (Mix between CivClicker and Sid Meier's Civ)
* **Kinematics Calculator*** See how graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration against time are related to each other by seeing how modifying one changes the values of the other graphs. Currently has **no** functionality.

## PHP
* **Chatroom** Very basic chatroom which manages accounts with MYSQL and writes to a file for messages. Good as a template for writing a quick means of communication. Requires you to write database info in login.php, register.php, and verify.php to work.
* **HTML Builder*** Writes HTML for people who do not know the language. Currently only includes formatted text and images, hence the asterisk. It usually makes more sense to just learn HTML, but when you are in a rush and need support for someone to write basic html this will do. You run builder.php and it writes to code.php.

* **Stock Research Evaluation**
	* **Quiz**: You are given information on a stock and submit whether you are bearish or bullish on the stock. You are awarded points if this matches analyst's opinions.

	* **Cleaner**: Jupyter Notebook which turns the raw HTML from which the stock list for the quiz was extracted into a clean list.
