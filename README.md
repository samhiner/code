# Projects Information

Small scripts/projects that have no other home

## PHP
* **Chatroom** Basic (Garbage) chatroom which manages accounts with MYSQL and writes to a file for messages. Requires you to write your MySQL database info in login.php, register.php, and verify.php before you run it.
* **HTML Builder*** Writes HTML for people who do not know the language (Also Garbage). Currently only includes formatted text and images, hence the asterisk. It usually makes more sense to just learn HTML, but when you are in a rush and need support for someone to write basic html this will do. You run builder.php and it writes to code.php.

## Python
* **Daily Coding Problems** My solutions to problems from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com).
* **Ciphers** A few random ciphers. Caesar and Vigenere ciphers implemented.
* **Linked List** Basic implementation of a one way linked list. Includes appending, prepending, displaying as an array, inserting, and removing.
* **MNIST-ML** A neural net built with Keras/Tensorflow that can predict handwritten numbers from the MNIST database with over 95% accuracy.
* **mlcrashcourse-mnist** Modified code from Google's ML Crash Course to predict MNIST numbers. Not accurate but I am using it as a reference for an alternative way to build a TF neural network.

## Shell Scripts
* **Website Update** Template for a script that automatically updates a website to match its GitHub repository. The PHP file triggers the script and contains guidance on setting it up so it is only triggered by a Webhook.
* **Repl.it Update*** Logs into your repl.it account and updates scripts based on their current version on GitHub.

# Extra Information

**License** This repository is more of a personal reference, but I put it under the MIT license, so if anyone is reading this and you find something that you like, you can use it for your own purposes.

*Projects with an asterisk do not have their main intended features implemented and may not work.
