# Projects Information

Small scripts/projects that have no other home

## PHP
* **Chatroom** Basic chatroom which manages accounts with MySQL and writes to a file for messages. Requires you to write your MySQL database info in login.php, register.php, and verify.php before you run it.

## Python
* **Daily Coding Problems** My solutions to problems from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com).
* **Ciphers** A few random ciphers. Caesar and Vigenere ciphers implemented.
* **Linked List** Basic implementation of a one way linked list. Includes appending, prepending, displaying as an array, inserting, and removing.
* **MNIST-ML** A neural net built with Keras/Tensorflow that can predict handwritten numbers from the MNIST database with over 95% accuracy.
* **mlcrashcourse-mnist** Modified code from Google's ML Crash Course to predict MNIST numbers. Not accurate but I am using it as a reference for an alternative way to build a TF neural network.
* **Picross*** Picross solver.

## Shell Scripts
* **Website Update** Template for a script that automatically updates a website to match its GitHub repository. The PHP file triggers the script and contains guidance on setting it up so it is only triggered by a Webhook.
* **Repl.it Update*** Logs into your repl.it account and updates scripts based on their current version on GitHub.
